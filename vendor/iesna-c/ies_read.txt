Description: IES_READ is an MS-DOS program that is designed to read
             photometric data files that conform to IES LM-63, "IES
             Standard File Format for Electronic Transfer of Photometric
             Data and Related Information."

Usage:       IES_READ data_file_name

             The program output will be displayed on the computer screen.
             To redirect this output to a file:

             IES_READ data_file_name > output_file_name

             The output file will contain ASCII text that can be edited
             by any text editor or word processor.

Example:     IES_READ 111621pn.3s

             or

             IES_READ 111621pn.3s > aardvark.txt

Notes:       1. There are three different versions of IES photometric
                data files, as defined by IES LM-63-1986, LM-63-1991,
                and LM-63-1995. This program will successfully read an
                IES photometric data file that conforms to any of these
                standards.

             2. If the photometric data file contains candela
                measurements at vertical angle intervals of 5.0 degrees,
                IES_READ will calculate the following information in
                accordance with IES LM-57-1982, "IES Recommended
                Procedure for Calculating Coefficients of Utilization,
                Wall and Ceiling Cavity Exitance":

                a) Luminaire efficiency
                b) Zonal lumens summary
                c) Coefficients of Utilization

                The CIE distribution type will also be determined.
